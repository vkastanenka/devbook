# Application description
Devbook is a MERN stack application meant to act as a social media platform for developers. It is based off the DevConnector project built by Brad Traversy for his Udemy course: MERN Stack Front To Back: Full Stack React, Redux & Node.js. While features were inspired by Brad's build, Devbook was built from the ground up to solidify and expand upon concepts learned in the course. As well as having a completely different design, new features were added such as a follow system that allows developers to view each other's content and easily find their favorite developers, and an expansion upon the original project's timeline concept. Timelines were changed from global timelines to personal timelines that would allow you to chronologically view only your own personal posts, and posts from developers that you followed.
